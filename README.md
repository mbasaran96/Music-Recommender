# Music-Recommender
This first project shows how a model can be created to predict someone's music taste.
The training and test set is based on random made up data from the Python Course (Code with Mosh).

# Getting Started
Start either by downloading the zip file or clone with HTTPS.

# Prerequisites
- Anaconda Distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- Python 3.7.3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

# Running

Required steps to run program via Jupyter Notebook (on Mac)

1. Clone the repository
2. Start a Jupyter Notebook server
  - After installing the Python 3.7.3 and the Anaconda Distribution of python, open the terminal and type
    
  ```jupyter notebook```

  - You will be redirected to a localhost server in your web browser running the Jupyter Notebook Dashboard at http://localhost:8888/tree
3. Locate the cloned repository
  - Locate the repository from the Jupyter Notebook dashboard and click the music-recommender.ipynb file in the project root
  - Click the cell containing the code and click run

# Visualization

For the visualization of the decision tree you need to extract the 'music-recommender_visualization.dot' file from the main code in 'Music-Recommender.ipynb'.
1. The 'music-recommender_visualization.dot' file is uploaded in Visual Studio Code
2. Install the extension 'Graphviz (dot) language support for Visual Studio Code' by Stephanvs
3. After installation click on the three dots on the top right corner and click on 'Open Preview to the Side'
4. The preview panel opens to the right and shows the graphical visualization of the decision tree
